## jSparrow 3.5.0 and jSparrow Maven Plugin 2.2.0 released!

*The sparrows round their new nests chirp with glee as jSparrow is hatching a rule in the syntax tree!*

The new [Replace Map::get by Map::getOrDefault](https://jsparrow.github.io/rules/map-get-or-default.html) rule automatically replaces invocations of [```Map::get```](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#get-java.lang.Object-) with the alternative [```Map::getOrDefault```](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#getOrDefault-java.lang.Object-V-), thus eliminating the succeeding **null** checks.

This new rule brings jSparrow to a total of [***58 automatic refactoring rules!***](https://jsparrow.github.io/rules/)

Find more information in our [jSparrow Eclipse](https://jsparrow.github.io/eclipse/release-notes.html#_3-5-0) and [jSparrow Maven](https://jsparrow.github.io/maven/release-notes.html#_2-2-0) Release Notes!

## New rule in jSparrow 3.5.0 and jSparrow Maven Plugin 2.2.0!!!

We are happy to announce that jSparrow will soon be enriched with a new rule!

jSparrow 3.5.0 and jSparrow Maven Plugin 2.2.0 are thoroughly tested and will be released on Thursday, May 16, 2019.

***Stay tuned for more information!***

## jSparrow 3.4.0 and jSparrow Maven Plugin 2.1.0 released!

Winter's days are past and it is time to start spring cleaning!

The [Remove Unused Parameters in Private Methods](https://jsparrow.github.io/rules/remove-unused-parameter.html) rule automatically removes unused parameters of private methods. This rule has been inspired by SonarQube's [Unused method parameters should be removed](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/default/rules?languages=java&open=squid%3AS1172&q=squid%3AS1172) major code smell.
